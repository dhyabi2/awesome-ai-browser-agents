## Cloud Browser Platforms

Managed browser infrastructure for AI agents — no local setup required.

- [AnchorBrowser](https://anchorbrowser.io) — Cloud browser platform for AI agents. Built-in stealth, CAPTCHA solving, residential proxies, and MCP support. Cloudflare Verified Browser Agent partner. Connects via WebSocket/CDP.
- [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com) — Headless browser infrastructure for AI agents. Playwright-native with session recording and debugging.
- [BrowserCloud](https://browsercloud.io) — Cloud browser infrastructure with multi-framework support (Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium). Enterprise focus.
- [Hyperbrowser](https://hyperbrowser.ai) — Cloud browser for web scraping and AI automation.

## Browser Automation Frameworks

Open source libraries for controlling browsers programmatically.

- [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) ★ — Microsoft's cross-browser automation library. Supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. TypeScript-first.
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) ★ — Google's headless Chrome automation library. The original WebSocket/CDP framework.
- [Selenium](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium) — The original browser automation framework. Wide language support, W3C WebDriver protocol.
- [Crawlee](https://github.com/apify/crawlee) — Node.js web scraping and browser automation library with built-in anti-blocking.

## MCP Servers & Browser Tools

Model Context Protocol integrations that give AI assistants browser capabilities.

- [mcp-browser-server](https://github.com/mehranakila56-ops/mcp-browser-server) — MCP server with 8 browser tools: navigate, click, type, screenshot, extract, evaluate. Supports local and cloud browsers.
- [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) — Official MCP reference servers including browser and filesystem access.
- [awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers) — Curated list of all MCP servers.
- [awesome-remote-mcp-servers](https://github.com/jaw9c/awesome-remote-mcp-servers) — Remote MCP servers you can connect to without running locally.
- [Vend MCP](https://extract.paypercall.dev/mcp) — Remote pay-per-call MCP server with 8 web-data and browser tools (extract, render, screenshot, table, search). Settles in Nano, no API key or subscription

## AI Agent Frameworks

Frameworks for building AI agents that can use browser tools.

- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) — The most popular LLM application framework. Has browser tool integrations.
- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) — Data framework for building LLM applications with web research capabilities.
- [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) — Microsoft's multi-agent framework. Agents can delegate browser tasks.
- [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) — Framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents with tool use.
- [AgentOps](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops) — Observability and evaluation for AI agents.

## Scraping & Data Extraction

Tools for extracting structured data from the web.

- [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) — Battle-tested Python scraping framework. Good for static content.
- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) — Python HTML/XML parser. Great for post-processing browser output.
- [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) — jQuery-like HTML parsing for Node.js.
- [Playwright Extra](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra) — Plugin system for Puppeteer/Playwright with stealth, adblocker, etc.

## Anti-Detection & Proxies

Tools for avoiding detection when automating browsers.

- [puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) — Apply stealth evasions to Puppeteer/Playwright.
- [playwright-stealth](https://github.com/Granitosaurus/playwright-stealth) — Stealth plugin for Playwright.
- [browser-agent-toolkit](https://github.com/mehranakila56-ops/browser-agent-toolkit) — Retry logic, human-like interactions, and session management utilities.
